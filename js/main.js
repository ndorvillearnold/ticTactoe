// Game rule

// You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
// The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
// When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.

//DONE : Do I add columns and rows if its easier?  3 rows and 3 columns or can we create cells
//if the box is empty the user can play
//DONE: If the box already filled do not enter code

//DONE: I will need an input box for player one and two to know who turn is next - add color to it when onClicked
//DONE:add CSS to add space and padding to the boxes when
//with css align text center, justify conent to the center, add gid to the middle of the box
//create an object with all of the params and methods - write sensible varible names
//should I create loops so the players dont have to refresh everytime
//alert who won the game
//alert more luck next time
